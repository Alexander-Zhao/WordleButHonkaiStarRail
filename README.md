This is a Honkai Star Rail + Wordle game! It involves clicking the icons of Honkai Star Rail characters which each have their own unique properties (Elements, Paths, and Rarity). By choosing a character it will show up on the table and when you confirm your choice, it will reveal which attributes were correct (a red X for wrong and a green check for correct). You get 8 attempts and you can reset once you're done. Resetting will choose a new character and submitting twice in a row just submits the same character. Have fun and goodluck!
